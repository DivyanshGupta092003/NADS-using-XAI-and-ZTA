# XAI-ZTA Network Anomaly Detection System

## Overview

Sophisticated detection mechanisms are essential due to the increasingly advanced nature of cyberattacks. This project introduces a novel approach by combining **Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI)** and **Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA)** to enhance the **efficiency, transparency, and reliability** of AI-based Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS).

This is the **first project** to integrate both XAI and ZTA into a unified anomaly detection framework, aiming to provide a robust, interpretable, and trustless model for detecting and mitigating threats in modern network environments.

## 🔍 Key Concepts

- **Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA)**  
  A network security paradigm that assumes no implicit trust, enforcing strict identity verification and least privilege access principles.

- **Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI)**  
  AI models that provide human-understandable reasoning for their decisions, essential for trust and accountability in cybersecurity applications.

- **XAI + ZTA Integration**  
  Merging explainability with a trustless framework allows for better insight, control, and prevention of cyber threats.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Evaluate and review recent frameworks combining AI with cybersecurity.
- Apply Zero Trust principles to isolate and control network access.
- Implement interpretable anomaly detection using XAI methods.
- Develop a scalable and secure IDS tailored for enterprise networks.
